A 1000 channels is a software project. Since September 2021 we have been developing a queer mapping platform with which queer narratives can be visualised and published on a map in an easily accessible way.

The diverse social and political activities of queer people are mostly fleeting, temporary and not a natural part of the public image of a city.
With A 1000 channels, we are developing a platform that offers queer actors, groups and projects a way to report on these spaces and events and make them visible.

#### Spaces

  This can be the alternative queer pub culture in a certain city during a certain time. Or also - more personally - stories, experiences, places of one or more people ...

  <div class="column">

  #### Interventions

  ... actions and demonstrations of a political movement, spatial interventions, spontaneous protests, public rallies.

  </div>
  <div class="column">

  #### Relations

  Events, places, narratives can be connected with each other. This creates spatial, temporal or associative constellations.

#### Past, Present, Future, Fiction

  With *A 1000 channels* one can document the past, capture the present or open up a glimpse into the future by, for example, making imaginary places and speculative futures visible as we imagine our queer lives.

  ### Ein Baukasten

With the platform *A 1000 channels*, we provide a construction kit with which you can gather content and media, combine them and relate them to each other â€“ spatially and temporally. <br>
By clicking on a worldwide map or a search field for addresses, you can create places or events. <br>
Text fields, uploading images, audio or video give you different ways of telling about the places, events and people who create them.

#### Datenschutz ðŸ¤«

We will pay special attention to data protection in the design of the tools. <br>
Images are automatically freed from metadata. <br>
We are experimenting with rasterisation of photos to obscure faces and there is to be a function to obscure exact location information. 

----

#### Map to go ðŸ‘œ

At the end of each project is the idea of a "map to go". <br>
In this way, we want to break a permanent dependence on our platform (and our project). <br>
You can simply take your map with you and publish it on your website, your own server, without having to install any software.
