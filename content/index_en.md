A 1000 channels is a software project. Since September 2021 we have been developing a queer mapping platform with which queer narratives can be visualised and published on a map in an easily accessible way.

The diverse social and political activities of queer people are mostly fleeting, temporary and not a natural part of the public image of a city.
With A 1000 channels, we are developing a platform that offers queer actors, groups and projects a way to report on these spaces and events and make them visible.

#### Spaces

  This can be the alternative queer pub culture in a certain city during a certain time. Or also - more personally - stories, experiences, places of one or more people ...

  </div>
  <div class="column">

  #### Interventions

  ... actions and demonstrations of a political movement, spatial interventions, spontaneous protests, public rallies.

  </div>
  <div class="column">

  #### Relations

  Events, places, narratives can be connected with each other. This creates spatial, temporal or associative constellations.

#### Past, Present, Future, Fiction

  With *A 1000 channels* one can document the past, capture the present or open up a glimpse into the future by, for example, making imaginary places and speculative futures visible as we imagine our queer lives.

### A construction kit
  
With the platform *A 1000 channels*, we provide a construction kit with which you can gather content and media, combine them and relate them to each other â€“ spatially and temporally. <br>
By clicking on a worldwide map or a search field for addresses, you can create places or events. <br>
Text fields, uploading images, audio or video give you different ways of telling about the places, events and people who create them. 

----
  
#### Data protection ðŸ¤«

We will pay special attention to data protection in the design of the tools. <br>
Images are automatically freed from metadata. <br>
We are experimenting with rasterisation of photos to obscure faces and there is to be a function to obscure exact location information. 

----

#### Map to go ðŸ‘œ

At the end of each project is the idea of a "map to go". <br>
In this way, we want to break a permanent dependence on our platform (and our project). <br>
You can simply take your map with you and publish it on your website, your own server, without having to install any software.

#### Intersections & Constellations. From Gay to Queer

Since summer 2021, the working group "Queer narratives, mapped" has been working with our platform. <br>
The result is a map that tells the story of how queer cultures and alliances have developed from lesbian and gay niches, with a temporal focus on the 1990s and a spatial focus on Bremen. <br>  
From interviews and the collection of flyers, posters, photos and other printed matter, a map has emerged that tells of different, personal perspectives on the emergence of queer communities and coalitions. 

*Work in Progress*

### Feedback ðŸŽ¤

If you have an idea for queer mappings, feel free to contact us.

We are currently looking for people with ideas for mappings to try out what we are just working on in practice.

Are you interested in collaboration and exchange about coding and design in queer contexts? Or do you have a little time for code reviews, translations and acceptance tests? <br>
We are happy about support :)

Your feedback helps us to improve the software.
