A 1000 channels is a software project. Since September 2021 we have been developing a queer mapping platform with which queer narratives can be visualised and published on a map in an easily accessible way.

The diverse social and political activities of queer people are mostly fleeting, temporary and not a natural part of the public image of a city.
With A 1000 channels, we are developing a platform that offers queer actors, groups and projects a way to report on these spaces and events and make them visible.
