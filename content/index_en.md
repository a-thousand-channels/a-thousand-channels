A 1000 channels is a software project. Since September 2021 we have been developing a queer mapping platform with which queer narratives can be visualised and published on a map in an easily accessible way.

The diverse social and political activities of queer people are mostly fleeting, temporary and not a natural part of the public image of a city.
With A 1000 channels, we are developing a platform that offers queer actors, groups and projects a way to report on these spaces and events and make them visible.

#### Spaces

  This can be the alternative queer pub culture in a certain city during a certain time. Or also - more personally - stories, experiences, places of one or more people ...

  <div class="column">

  #### Interventions

  ... actions and demonstrations of a political movement, spatial interventions, spontaneous protests, public rallies.

  <div class="column">

  #### Relations

  Events, places, narratives can be connected with each other. This creates spatial, temporal or associative constellations.

#### Past, Present, Future, Fiction

  With *A 1000 channels* one can document the past, capture the present or open up a glimpse into the future by, for example, making imaginary places and speculative futures visible as we imagine our queer lives.
